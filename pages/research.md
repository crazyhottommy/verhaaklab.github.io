The Verhaak lab is part of the [Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the MD Anderson Cancer Center](http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/). Our research focus is the analysis of cancer genomics data to improve our understanding of cancer biology. Our computational methods to analyze *[big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data)* from DNA and RNA sequencing, genome wide copy number and expression profiling are used to learn what determines tumor progression. We are funded by and play a central in [The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network](http://cancergenome.nih.gov) and have built computational pipelines for massive parallel processing of sequencing data and microarray expression data which are being used extensively in TCGA.
