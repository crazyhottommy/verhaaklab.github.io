The Verhaak lab is physically located in the [Department of Genomic Medicine](http://www.mdanderson.org/education-and-research/departments-programs-and-labs/departments-and-divisions/genomic-medicine/index.html) at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. We are also affiliated with the [Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/). Our research focus is the analysis of cancer genomics data to improve our understanding of cancer biology. Our computational methods to analyze *[big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data)* from high througput sequencing to learn what determines tumor progression and treatment resistance. We are funded by and play a central role in [The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network](http://cancergenome.nih.gov) and have built computational pipelines for massive parallel processing of sequencing data and microarray expression data which are being used extensively in TCGA.
