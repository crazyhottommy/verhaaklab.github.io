The Verhaak lab is part of the [Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the MD Anderson Cancer Center](http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/). Our research focus is the analysis of cancer genomics data to improve our understanding of cancer biology. Our computational methods to analyze very large (Tb sized) data sets from DNA and RNA sequencing, genome wide copy number and expression profiling are used to learn what determines tumor progression. We are funded by and play a central in [The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network](http://cancergenome.nih.gov) and have built computational pipelines for massive parallel processing of sequencing data and microarray expression data which are being used extensively in TCGA.
